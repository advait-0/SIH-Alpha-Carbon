# Smart Irrigation System
## Aim:
The goal of this research is to create a cutting-edge irrigation system that intelligently adjusts irrigation patterns based on soil moisture availability in crop root areas. The system will efficiently control irrigation in a piped and micro-irrigation network by combining moisture sensors, Machine Learning, and Modern Long Range (LoRa) communication protocols.

### Project Overview:
The project leverages cutting-edge technologies to optimize irrigation practices. 	
It involves the following key components:

**1. Moisture Sensors and Data Acquisition:**
Utilize moisture sensors placed strategically in the field to continuously monitor soil moisture levels.
Sensors will transmit data wirelessly to a central hub via the ESP Now protocol.

**2. Data Processing and Machine Learning:**
 A Raspberry Pi or Nvidia Jetson Nano will retrieve soil moisture data from the Firebase database.
Utilize the best of SARIMAX and FbProphet Machine Learning Tools to process this data and make intelligent decisions regarding valve control.

**3. Valve Regulation and Feedback Loop:**
The ML algorithm will determine the optimal extent of Globe valve openings based on soil moisture data.
Instructions will be published back to the Firebase database, passed back to the microcontrollers for optimal flow.

**4. Flow Rate Feedback:**
Flow rate in the valves will serve as a feedback mechanism, ensuring precise irrigation.
This feedback loop guarantees that water application matches the requirements of the crops.

**5. Integration of LoRa Technology:**
In the final implementation, LoRa technology having a range of 4.8-15 KM will be utilized for achieving enhanced communication ranges.
 Data will be transmitted via a LoRaWAN module for increased reliability and coverage.

### Key Features:
**1. Fault-Tolerant System:**
The system will be designed to handle unexpected scenarios by incorporating random error-checking mechanisms into the model.

**2. Cost-Effectiveness:**
By utilizing open-source technologies and optimizing hardware choices, the project aims to provide an economically viable solution for precision irrigation.

**3. GSM Fall Back Communication:**	
In case of communication failures, the system will have a GSM-based backup strategy to ensure uninterrupted operation.

**4. Battery-Saving Measures:**
Real-time clock functionality will be integrated to manage power consumption efficiently, maximizing battery life.

### Expected Outcomes:
**1. Increased Crop Yield:** By ensuring precise and timely irrigation, the system aims to improve crop health and productivity.

**2. Water Conservation:** By avoiding over-irrigation, the project contributes to sustainable water management practices.

**3. Scalability and Upgradability:** The system can be scaled to accommodate various field sizes providing the same usability and precise functionality for small farms as well as extensive farms.

## Conclusion:	
This project aims to revolutionize irrigation practices by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and advanced communication technologies. It has the potential to significantly impact agricultural productivity and water resource management as it is a viable and scalable solution for enhanced agricultural produce.
